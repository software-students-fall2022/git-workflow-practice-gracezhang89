[Front-End Principles for Designers](https://jonyablonski.com/articles/2015/front-end-principles-for-designers/)

Within software development, I am particularly interested in code that intersects with design. I prefer frontend assignments and have experience prototyping. This article is interesting to me because it provides a solid high-level overview of what a designer may need to know to effectively work with a developer. It also links to multiple resources which explain more each concept more in-depth.

Andrei's comments: I am also interested in creative code! I hope to be able to create my designs one day as a hybrid designer-developer. I bookmarked all of the resources this article references.
